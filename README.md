# d3-tutorial
results from a basic d3 tutorial, using a randomly generated dataset for each chart

to run: point browser to `file:///path/to/index.html`

for the lazy, it looks like this:

### given the dataset:
[42,53,75,83,76,47,65,29,16,78,5,60,32,7,85,33,2,52,6,2,92,98,82,96,14] and a really long set of points for the scatter plot...
(the data is randomly generated on each page refresh)

## circles:
colors are generated randomly, and sized based on the number from the dataset
